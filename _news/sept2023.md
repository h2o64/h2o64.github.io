I will be at Orsay for the [Probabilistic sampling for physics: finding needles in a field of high-dimensional haystacks](https://indico.ijclab.in2p3.fr/event/9042/) workshop organized by Institut Pascal from the 4th September to the 22nd September. Moreover, I will be at Marne-la-Vall√©e for the [Sampling high-dimensional probability measures:
applications in (non)equilibrium molecular dynamics and statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/aleiac/anr-sineq/summer-school-mol-dyn-on-julia) at the [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) lab where I will be presenting 2 posters.
