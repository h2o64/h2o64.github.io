I will be at the [ISBA 2024 World Meeting](https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home) (Venice, Italy) in July 2024. I will give a talk entitled "Transporting measures
for sampling: parametric and non-parametric approaches inspired by generative modeling" in the invited session "Monte Carlo algorithms using modern hardware" chaired by [Charles Margossian](https://charlesm93.github.io/) (Flatiron Institute, New York, USA).
