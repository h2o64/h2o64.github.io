My latest paper [Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampling for multi-modal distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10758) co-authored with Maxence Noble, Marylou Gabri√© and Alain Durmus has been accepted at ICLR 2025. Moreover, my reflexion paper [Improving the evaluation of samplers on multi-modal targets](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d91E9RhVFU) written with Maxence and Marylou was accepted at the workshop Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference: Learning meets Sampling at ICLR 2025. See you in Singapore !
